### Business Problem: What decisions need to be made?
A small bank has the responsibility of determining if a customer is creditworthy to give loan to. Usually the bank receives about 200 loan applications per week which are approved by hand, however due to a financial scandal that hit competitive bank, they have now received nearly 500 loan applications. My manager wants me to figure out how to process all these applications within a week. With predictive analytics; I need to systematically evaluate the creditworthiness of all the new applicants and provide my manager with a list of creditworthy customers in the next 2 days
